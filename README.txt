Wiktionary Text Parser
Author: Yves Bourque w/ enhancements by chris cargile

You should definitely refer to the Yves Bourque's wikparser code on github as the authoritative source code for use under this project name, but I forked his project here to add some of my own code to allow exposing wiktionary translations as a "service" in the browser and to incorporate some speed tests for querying the mysql-stored wikitext data and extracting it as a translation.

Yves Bourques original branch (the main branch) is here:
https://github.com/ybourque/Wikparser

Further bg: Yves' project was used as the code-basis for me to begin with in producing code that would allow me to achieve my goals stated in the "Hypothesis"(.pdf) for my grad-school CS-Software Engineering "write-a-conference-ready abstract" course.  To explore the research I began from you may find papers I read before beginning the effort at: https://goo.gl/kGSc16
