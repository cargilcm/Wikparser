Wiktionary Text Parser
Author: Yves Bourque
http://www.igrec.ca/projects/wiktionary-text-parser/

YOu should definitely refer to the Yves Bourque's wikparser code on github as the authoritative source code for use under this project name, but I forked his project here to have a play around with it and added some of my own code for running separate tests, etc.  

Yves Bourques project is here:
